## About Me

-  I'm currently a Data Analyst working in the Electric Cooperative sector.
- 🔭 I am passionate about learning new tools, techniques, and subject-areas - staying within your subject matter expertise is a sure-fire way to become stagnant (and you will miss out on different ways of thinking in order to further yourself in your own field).
